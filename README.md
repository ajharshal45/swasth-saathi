# swasth-saathi
Swasth Saathi is a network-adaptive telemedicine prototype that provides safe, rule-based triage and clinical decision support for rural and low-connectivity environments. It uses a store-and-forward approach with offline support, adaptive inputs, and doctor-in-the-loop validation to ensure continuity of care.
